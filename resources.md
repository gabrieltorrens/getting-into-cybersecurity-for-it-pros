These are some of the resources that I've used and recommend.\

As you start to take on these resources, you may feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of content and occasional difficulty spike. This is part of the learning process. The goal is to touch everything. As your learning deepens, you will be better prepared to defend enterprise infrastructure.

## Pay What You Can - Antisyphon Training
Last I checked the “Pay What You Can” courses are free as long as you register 24-48 hours before the course starts. After that point, the option to join for $0 may not be available.
Free recordings are often available on Youtube, and late registration is possible, see their Discord for more information.

These recommended trainings are up to 16 hours over 4 days and taught once a quarter.

## TryHackMe
TryHackMe’s free tier will require you to set up a local Kali Linux VM and use an OpenVPN profile provided by THM. You will not need the VM for all rooms.

### Recommended Rooms / Learning Paths:

- [Advent of Cyber](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/adventofcyber3): The “Advent of Cyber” courses are a mess of topics, but they provide a good crash course into what THM is trying to teach you.
